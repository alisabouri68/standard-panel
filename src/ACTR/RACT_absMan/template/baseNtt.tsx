 * This is a JavaScript code snippet that exports an object. The object contains a property called Meta which itself is an object.

 * The Meta object has five properties:
 **   id which is an empty string
 **   title which is an empty string
 **   description which is an empty string
 **   version which is an empty string
 **   axisArray which is an empty array
 **   axisSerial which is set to 0
 *
 *   This code can be used as a starting point for building an object that will store metadata about NTTs.
