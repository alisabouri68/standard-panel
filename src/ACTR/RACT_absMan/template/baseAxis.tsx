 * This is a JavaScript code snippet that exports an object. The object contains a property called Meta which itself is an object.

 **   id which is an empty string
 **   title which is an empty string
 **   description which is an empty string
 **   packArray which is an empty array
 **   packSerial which is set to 0
 *
 *   This code can be used as a starting point for building an object that will store metadata about Axis.
